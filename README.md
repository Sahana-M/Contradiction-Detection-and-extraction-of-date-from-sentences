# Contradiction-Detection-and-extraction-of-date-from-sentences
This project of artificial intelligence will help us to extract the date from a natural language(here English)  and if any contraacting dates are present then give a prompt


suppose you give a sentence "I will be two days after today in Delhi and three days after yesterday in Bangalore" 

Suppose today is 10-10-2018,  the output will be as 

'12-10-2018' 'Delhi'
'12-10-2018' 'Bangalore' 
'There is a contradiction on date 12-10-2018'

This is done so to manage conflicting meetings in companies or any organisations, to organise their time and date efficiently
